Yuki-onna’s Lament	       	 		       	    	   	 
	      	 	      	  	      		  	 	   
Through silent pines and drifting white,       		      		    
She glides beneath the moon’s cold light. 	   	       	   	   
A phantom wrapped in veils of snow,	       	    	     	    	    
With frozen breath and lips aglow.     	    	  	       	    	      
      	 	   	     	   	     	   		    	    
Her eyes reflect the silver sky,  	 	       	       	 	     
A gaze as deep as winter’s sigh.     	      	  		     	  
She hums a tune both sweet and low,       	 	 	 	       
A lullaby for souls below.      	    	   	  	  	    
     	  	  	     	       	      	    	   	 
The weary traveler, lost and weak,	      		  	     	 
Hears echoes in the frozen creek.     		    	      	   	    
A voice like wind through hollow trees,    	   	  	    	  
It beckons softly on the breeze. 	  	    			       
       	       	 		 	      	 	       	       
He follows footprints faint and light,	   	 	    	   
That vanish ere they meet his sight.	 	      	 	  	      
Through endless fields of ice and stone,  	     	      	     	   
He walks, yet feels he’s not alone. 	      	      	 	      	   
       	       	    	     	   	       	 		  
She waits upon a hill of frost,
A ghostly queen, both pale and lost.
Her outstretched hand, so soft, so fair,
Yet death itself is resting there.

He takes her hand—his breath is still,
His heart succumbs to winter’s chill.
A fleeting kiss, a final sigh,
A whispered name, then he must die.

No footprints mark where she has tread,
No warmth remains where she has fed.
Yet somewhere in the midnight deep,
The mountain winds begin to weep.

For Yuki-onna walks alone,
Bound to ice, her heart of stone.
She loves, she longs, but all must fade—
A fleeting dream, a wraith betrayed.

And when the storm begins to call,
She disappears like drifting pall.
Yet listen close when snowflakes fall,
You’ll hear her sorrow, soft and small.
